# Plugin bundles

Opuncleh supports one shared class of external plugin package: **bundle
plugins**.

Today that means three closely related ecosystems:

- Codex bundles
- Claude bundles
- Cursor bundles

Opuncleh shows all of them as `Format: bundle` in `opuncleh plugins list`.
Verbose output and `opuncleh plugins inspect <id>` also show the subtype
(`codex`, `claude`, or `cursor`).

## What a bundle is

A bundle is a **content/metadata pack**, not a native in-process Opuncleh
plugin.

Today, Opuncleh does **not** execute bundle runtime code in-process. Instead,
it detects known bundle files, reads the metadata, and maps supported bundle
content into native Opuncleh surfaces such as skills, hook packs, MCP config,
and embedded Pi settings.

That is the main trust boundary:

- native Opuncleh plugin: runtime module executes in-process
- bundle: metadata/content pack, with selective feature mapping

## Shared bundle model

Codex, Claude, and Cursor bundles are similar enough that Opuncleh treats them
as one normalized model.

Shared idea:

- a small manifest file, or a default directory layout
- one or more content roots such as `skills/` or `commands/`
- optional tool/runtime metadata such as MCP, hooks, agents, or LSP
- install as a directory or archive, then enable in the normal plugin list

Common Opuncleh behavior:

- detect the bundle subtype
- normalize it into one internal bundle record
- map supported parts into native Opuncleh features
- report unsupported parts as detected-but-not-wired capabilities

In practice, most users do not need to think about the vendor-specific format
first. The more useful question is: which bundle surfaces does Opuncleh map
today?

## Detection order

Opuncleh prefers native Opuncleh plugin/package layouts before bundle handling.

Practical effect:

- `opuncleh.plugin.json` wins over bundle detection
- package installs with valid `package.json` + `opuncleh.extensions` use the
  native install path
- if a directory contains both native and bundle metadata, Opuncleh treats it
  as native first

That avoids partially installing a dual-format package as a bundle and then
loading it later as a native plugin.

## What works today

Opuncleh normalizes bundle metadata into one internal bundle record, then maps
supported surfaces into existing native behavior.

### Supported now

#### Skill content

- bundle skill roots load as normal Opuncleh skill roots
- Claude `commands` roots are treated as additional skill roots
- Cursor `.cursor/commands` roots are treated as additional skill roots

This means Claude markdown command files work through the normal Opuncleh skill
loader. Cursor command markdown works through the same path.

#### Hook packs

- bundle hook roots work **only** when they use the normal Opuncleh hook-pack
  layout. Today this is primarily the Codex-compatible case:
  - `HOOK.md`
  - `handler.ts` or `handler.js`

#### MCP for Pi

- enabled bundles can contribute MCP server config
- Opuncleh merges bundle MCP config into the effective embedded Pi settings as
  `mcpServers`
- Opuncleh also exposes supported bundle MCP tools during embedded Pi agent
  turns by launching supported stdio MCP servers as subprocesses
- project-local Pi settings still apply after bundle defaults, so workspace
  settings can override bundle MCP entries when needed

#### Embedded Pi settings

- Claude `settings.json` is imported as default embedded Pi settings when the
  bundle is enabled
- Opuncleh sanitizes shell override keys before applying them

Sanitized keys:

- `shellPath`
- `shellCommandPrefix`

### Detected but not executed

These surfaces are detected, shown in bundle capabilities, and may appear in
diagnostics/info output, but Opuncleh does not run them yet:

- Claude `agents`
- Claude `hooks.json` automation
- Claude `lspServers`
- Claude `outputStyles`
- Cursor `.cursor/agents`
- Cursor `.cursor/hooks.json`
- Cursor `.cursor/rules`
- Codex inline/app metadata beyond capability reporting

## Capability reporting

`opuncleh plugins inspect <id>` shows bundle capabilities from the normalized
bundle record.

Supported capabilities are loaded quietly. Unsupported capabilities produce a
warning such as:

```text
bundle capability detected but not wired into Opuncleh yet: agents
```

Current exceptions:

- Claude `commands` is considered supported because it maps to skills
- Claude `settings` is considered supported because it maps to embedded Pi settings
- Cursor `commands` is considered supported because it maps to skills
- bundle MCP is considered supported because it maps into embedded Pi settings
  and exposes supported stdio tools to embedded Pi
- Codex `hooks` is considered supported only for Opuncleh hook-pack layouts

## Format differences

The formats are close, but not byte-for-byte identical. These are the practical
differences that matter in Opuncleh.

### Codex

Typical markers:

- `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`
- optional `skills/`
- optional `hooks/`
- optional `.mcp.json`
- optional `.app.json`

Codex bundles fit Opuncleh best when they use skill roots and Opuncleh-style
hook-pack directories.

### Claude

Opuncleh supports both:

- manifest-based Claude bundles: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
- manifestless Claude bundles that use the default Claude layout

Default Claude layout markers Opuncleh recognizes:

- `skills/`
- `commands/`
- `agents/`
- `hooks/hooks.json`
- `.mcp.json`
- `.lsp.json`
- `settings.json`

Claude-specific notes:

- `commands/` is treated like skill content
- `settings.json` is imported into embedded Pi settings
- `.mcp.json` and manifest `mcpServers` can expose supported stdio tools to
  embedded Pi
- `hooks/hooks.json` is detected, but not executed as Claude automation

### Cursor

Typical markers:

- `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`
- optional `skills/`
- optional `.cursor/commands/`
- optional `.cursor/agents/`
- optional `.cursor/rules/`
- optional `.cursor/hooks.json`
- optional `.mcp.json`

Cursor-specific notes:

- `.cursor/commands/` is treated like skill content
- `.cursor/rules/`, `.cursor/agents/`, and `.cursor/hooks.json` are
  detect-only today

## Claude custom paths

Claude bundle manifests can declare custom component paths. Opuncleh treats
those paths as **additive**, not replacing defaults.

Currently recognized custom path keys:

- `skills`
- `commands`
- `agents`
- `hooks`
- `mcpServers`
- `lspServers`
- `outputStyles`

Examples:

- default `commands/` plus manifest `commands: "extra-commands"` =>
  Opuncleh scans both
- default `skills/` plus manifest `skills: ["team-skills"]` =>
  Opuncleh scans both

## Security model

Bundle support is intentionally narrower than native plugin support.

Current behavior:

- bundle discovery reads files inside the plugin root with boundary checks
- skills and hook-pack paths must stay inside the plugin root
- bundle settings files are read with the same boundary checks
- supported stdio bundle MCP servers may be launched as subprocesses for
  embedded Pi tool calls
- Opuncleh does not load arbitrary bundle runtime modules in-process

This makes bundle support safer by default than native plugin modules, but you
should still treat third-party bundles as trusted content for the features they
do expose.

## Install examples

```bash
opuncleh plugins install ./my-codex-bundle
opuncleh plugins install ./my-claude-bundle
opuncleh plugins install ./my-cursor-bundle
opuncleh plugins install ./my-bundle.tgz
opuncleh plugins marketplace list <marketplace-name>
opuncleh plugins install <plugin-name>@<marketplace-name>
opuncleh plugins inspect my-bundle
```

If the directory is a native Opuncleh plugin/package, the native install path
still wins.

For Claude marketplace names, Opuncleh reads the local Claude known-marketplace
registry at `~/.claude/plugins/known_marketplaces.json`. Marketplace entries
can resolve to bundle-compatible directories/archives or to native plugin
sources; after resolution, the normal install rules still apply.

## Troubleshooting

### Bundle is detected but capabilities do not run

Check `opuncleh plugins inspect <id>`.

If the capability is listed but Opuncleh says it is not wired yet, that is a
real product limit, not a broken install.

### Claude command files do not appear

Make sure the bundle is enabled and the markdown files are inside a detected
`commands` root or `skills` root.

### Claude settings do not apply

Current support is limited to embedded Pi settings from `settings.json`.
Opuncleh does not treat bundle settings as raw Opuncleh config patches.

### Claude hooks do not execute

`hooks/hooks.json` is only detected today.

If you need runnable bundle hooks today, use the normal Opuncleh hook-pack
layout through a supported Codex hook root or ship a native Opuncleh plugin.
